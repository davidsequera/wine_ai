##Thematic
Neural Networks
The objective of the next workshop is to do a classification analysis using feed-forward neural networks
##Dataset
We will work with the dataset of the UCI repository, so it must be downloaded from the following link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality From which you must select one of the two types of wines
###Understanding the dataset
1.	What information does the dataset present? Dwrite the main characteristics of the dataset, and in turn identify the variable on which you want to make the prediction.
2.	Perform a graphical analysis that allows you to see the distribution and see the correlations
###Constructing the dataset
To perform the classification analysis, it is suggested to perform a partitioning between 
Two sets (training, testing) 
1.	What proportion of training set and tests?
2.	I would change the results if the ratio is changed
Modelling
Design different solutions using different architectures 
1.	Perceptron 
2.	Neural network with a hidden layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of inputs 
3.	A neural network with two hidden layers with two neurons in each hidden layer. 
The firing function for neurons in the second and third models will be sigmoid function All neurons must have bias (bias)
 Analysis of Results
Construct the confusion matrix, 
Streamline theevaluation metrics (acuraccy, accuracy, recall, f1 score) for each of the models. 
Perform a comparative analysis of each of the results of each model. 
##Bono
1.	Develop a model to determine wine quality that works for both white and red wine 


##Recomendations
To perform the analysis of the problem, the dataset must be downloaded. 
For the development of this workshop it is necessary to have a work environment that includes a Python3 interpreter. 
Use libraries for the treatment, manipulation and visualization of data results such as pandas, matplotlib, etc. 
For network programming you can use pure algorithms in Python, or use the libraries of Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras 
The delivery of the workshop must be in a PDF document with the development of the questions and the files that include the implementations
